When No Exception is Raised: If no exception is raised within the try block,
 the code in the finally block is executed after the try block completes its execution. 
This allows you to perform cleanup or resource release operations, ensuring they always run,
 whether or not an exception occurred.

 try:
    # Code that may or may not raise an exception

except ExceptionType as e:
   
finally:
    # Code that is always executed, regardless of exceptions
