
15) When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?

In a try-except-else block in Python, the else part is executed when no exceptions are 
raised within the try block. It provides a way to specify code that should be executed 
if the code in the try block runs without any exceptions. If an exception is raised within 
the try block, the code in the else block is skipped, and the program continues with the except block, 
which handles the exception.

try:
    x = 10 / 2  # No exception here
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")
else:
    print("No exception was raised.")
